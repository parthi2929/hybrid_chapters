This is a sample template with script to facilitate mixed chapters from raw tex files and tex files generated from ipython notebooks. 

[Main Demo](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/parthi2929/hybrid_chapters/blob/master/main.pdf)

Issues:
The tex from ipython is not pretty yet but almost gets the job done. There are no boxes for code cells, indentation sometimes messed up etc. Hope I could fix this soon in future.
